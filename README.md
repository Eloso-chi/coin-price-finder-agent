# Coin Price Discovery Agent

A dealer-oriented pricing tool that calculates **Fair Market Value (FMV)** for US coins and bullion bars by combining PCGS catalog data, eBay sold-comp analysis, and Terapeak market data. It produces buy/sell recommendations with confidence scores — designed for quick, data-backed decisions at a coin show or behind a counter.

## What It Does

1. **Identifies the coin** — accepts a PCGS cert number, barcode, PCGS coin number, or free-text description (e.g. "1881-CC Morgan dollar MS 64").
2. **Enriches via PCGS** — fetches price guide value, population, auction history, mintage, and reference images from the PCGS CoinFacts API.
3. **Pulls eBay sold comps** — queries up to three eBay APIs (Marketplace Insights → Finding → Browse) to collect recent sold prices, then scores and filters them for relevance.
4. **Supplements with Terapeak data** — imports Terapeak CSV exports (manual upload or auto-import from `data/terapeak/`) for additional sold-comp coverage with daily quota tracking.
5. **Computes FMV** — blends PCGS and eBay data using a weighted median with outlier removal, producing a confidence-scored valuation.
6. **Generates buy/sell decisions** — outputs max-buy thresholds (70/75/80% of FMV) and sell tiers (fast/normal/premium) with a recommendation.
7. **Batch pricing** — prices up to 25 coins in a single request.
8. **Price history charting** — returns time-series sold-price data with optional spot-price metal overlay.
9. **Live metals tracking** — background polling (every 30 min) with round-robin across providers, plus daily history snapshots.
10. **Market matrix** — year × mint grid of median completed prices and cheapest BIN listings, enriched with Numista rarity data.

Also supports **bullion bars** (any metal, any size), **proof/mint sets**, **rolls**, and **lunar series** with dedicated input flows and eBay keyword strategies.

## Frontend — Web UI

The browser UI is a single-page app served from `public/index.html` with a dark theme and seven tabbed panels. All client-side JavaScript is split across four modules loaded in order: `crypto.js` → `auth.js` → `storage.js` → `my-coins.js`.

### Tabs

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Price Discovery** | Main search — two sub-modes: Coin (structured or quick-search entry) and Bar/Bullion. Submits to `/api/price` or `/api/bar-price`. Renders FMV hero card with image gallery, confidence score, buy/sell decisions, metadata chips, eBay stats, comp list, and raw JSON. |
| **Melt Calculator** | Offline calculator for 80+ US coin types and 20 bar sizes. Auto-fetches spot prices from `/api/metals` and polls every 5 minutes. Shows per-coin, per-roll, and total melt values at spot and spot+premium. |
| **Live eBay Tracker** | Market matrix from `/api/market/ebay`. Three display modes: Year × Mint (numismatic coins), Year × Grade (bullion), and Brand table (bars). Cells show median sold price, cheapest BIN link, key date badge, and Numista rarity. Color-coded legend. |
| **Sold Data** | Terapeak CSV import UI (drag-and-drop or file picker) with search term input. Datasets list with delete. Visual daily quota meter (250/day default) with manual logging and reset. Admin endpoints require `x-api-key`. |
| **My Coins** 🔒 | Auth-gated. Encrypted coin collection stored in IndexedDB. Shows portfolio summary (total FMV, total cost, unrealized P/L, coin count) and full table with per-coin FMV, confidence, Troy Oz, cost basis, P/L, melt value, eBay average, range, notes, date added, and remove button. Checkbox column with select-all for multi-select bulk delete. Export/Import backup buttons (JSON and Excel .xlsx), Change Password. |
| **Price History** 🔒 | Auth-gated. Canvas-drawn chart from `/api/coin-history`. Shows daily median prices with IQR band, outlier dots, and optional precious-metal spot overlay (dashed line). Supports 90/180/365-day ranges. |
| **About** | Confidence score key, privacy/security explanation, how login works, feature previews for logged-out users, and legal disclaimer. |

### Zero-Knowledge Auth System

The authentication system is **entirely client-side** — the server has zero knowledge of accounts, passwords, or collection data.

- **Signup** — generates a UUID user ID, derives an AES-256-GCM encryption key from username + password via PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations, SHA-256), encrypts a known plaintext as a password verifier, and stores `{userId, salt, verifier}` in `localStorage`.
- **Login** — re-derives the key from the stored salt and checks the verifier. The `CryptoKey` lives only in memory.
- **Page reload** — the in-memory key is lost. The UI detects the stale session via `pendingReauth()` and auto-opens the login dialog pre-filled with the username.
- **Password change** — derives a new key with a fresh salt, updates the verifier, and re-encrypts all coins in IndexedDB via `CoinStorage.reEncryptAll()`.
- **Recovery key** — at signup a random 128-bit seed is generated and presented as an 8-word phrase (from a 256-word BIP39 subset). A second AES-256 key is derived from the seed and used to wrap the same random data key that the password key wraps. If the user forgets their password, the recovery phrase unwraps the data key and lets them set a new password — no re-encryption of stored coins is needed. Legacy accounts created before the recovery key feature continue to work (password-derived key used directly).

No passwords, keys, or collection data ever leave the browser. The server cannot read, access, or reconstruct any user data.

### Encrypted Coin Storage

- **Database:** IndexedDB database `CoinVault`, object store `inventory`, composite key `[userId, coinHash]`.
- **Per-coin encryption:** Each coin record is JSON-serialized and encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a random 12-byte IV. Only the encrypted ciphertext + IV are stored.
- **Deduplication:** Coins are hashed by `SHA-256(series|year|mint|grade|notes)` to prevent duplicates while allowing distinct lots (e.g. same coin, different notes).
- **"I Have This Coin" button:** Appears in Price Discovery results. If logged in, adds the coin to the encrypted collection with one click. If logged out, shows a lock icon that opens the login dialog.

### Export & Import Backup

- **Export** — decrypts all coins and downloads a **plaintext JSON** file (`coin-collection-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`). The export contains `{format, exportedAt, count, coins[]}` with each coin's series, year, mint, grade, weight, query, and dateAdded. No encryption in the file — it's a portable backup.
- **Import** — reads the JSON backup, validates the `coin-price-agent-backup-v1` format header, and re-encrypts each coin under the current user's key. Skips duplicates (by coinHash). Works across accounts — if a user loses their login and creates a new account, they can import a previous backup into the new account.
### Excel (.xlsx) Import

The app can import coin collections from Excel spreadsheets via `POST /api/import/excel`. The mapper (`src/utils/excelMapper.js`) handles:

- **Flexible header matching** -- recognizes common column name variations (e.g. "Troy oz", "Tory oz", "troy_oz"; "Mint Mark", "mint_mark", "mintmark")
- **Series normalization** -- maps informal names (e.g. "ASE" -> "American Silver Eagle", "canadian maple leaf" -> "Canadian Silver Maple Leaf") to canonical pricing engine names via a 20+ entry alias table
- **Smart parsing** -- extracts year, mint mark, and series from free-text "Coin Name" column; prefers dedicated Year/Mint Mark columns when present
- **Metal/weight detection** -- reads troy oz weight and maps to base metal (silver/gold) with fineness
- **Year validation** -- requires 4-digit year between 1600-2099; rejects partial years
- **Cost/notes/quantity pass-through** -- preserves cost basis, notes, and quantity from the spreadsheet

The endpoint accepts `.xlsx` files up to 10 MB and returns the mapped coins in the standard backup JSON format, ready for client-side encryption and storage.

### Auto-Seed Test Account

On every page load, the app checks whether the `testcollector` demo account exists in localStorage. If missing (e.g. after a browser cache clear or codespace rebuild), it silently creates the account with 10 sample coins spanning different series (Morgans, Peace, Kennedy, Walking Liberty, ASE, Washington, Roosevelt, Buffalo, Lincoln). The seed runs in the background and logs out immediately, so the user always sees the normal login prompt. Credentials: `testcollector` / `Coins2026!`.
### Backup Reminder

The `BackupReminder` module (in `storage.js`) tracks coin additions and time since last backup in `localStorage`. It shows a yellow banner in the My Coins tab prompting the user to export:

| Trigger | Message |
|---------|---------|
| First coin ever added | "You added your first coin! Export a backup so you never lose your collection." |
| 10+ coins added since last backup | "You've added several coins since your last backup. Time to save a copy!" |
| 30+ days since last backup | "It's been a while since your last backup. Export one to stay safe." |

Dismissing snoozes the prompt for 7 days. Exporting resets all counters.

### Auth-Gated Tabs

The My Coins and Price History tabs are locked for logged-out users:

- Tab buttons show a 🔒 lock icon and muted styling.
- Clicking a locked tab opens the login dialog instead of switching panels.
- A teaser banner below the tab bar reads "Unlock My Coins & Price History" with a login CTA.
- The About tab shows feature preview cards with mocked UI (sample portfolio table, sample price chart) and login buttons.
- All lock/teaser state updates reactively on login/logout.

### Cross-Tab Linkage

- **Price Discovery → Live eBay Tracker:** After pricing a coin, the tracker's series input is pre-populated. Switching to the tracker tab auto-loads the matrix.
- **Price Discovery → Price History:** A `CoinHistoryLink` object stores the query. Switching to the History tab auto-runs the chart.

## Key Concepts

### FMV Core

Fair Market Value is a blended estimate from up to three data sources:

| Source | Weight (Certified) | Weight (Raw) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| eBay Sold Comps | 65% | 80% |
| PCGS Price Guide | 25% | 20% |
| PCGS Auction History | 10% | — |

If a source is unavailable, weights are renormalized among the remaining sources.

The eBay component uses a **weighted median** that favors recent sales (recency decay: `1 / (1 + daysSince/90)`) and high-relevance matches (match score from `scoreMatch()`).

### US Comps vs Global Comps

The agent queries eBay US first. If US sold comps fall below the threshold (default: 8), it pulls global comps as a supplement. The valuation engine prefers US comps and applies a confidence penalty when relying on global data.

### Confidence Score

A 0–100 score reflecting how trustworthy the FMV estimate is:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Sample size | Up to 30–40 pts |
| Price dispersion (low spread) | Up to 20–25 pts |
| Match quality (avg score) | Up to 15–25 pts |
| PCGS verified | +10 |
| PCGS price guide available | +10 |
| Auction data available | +5 |
| 20+ comps bonus | +10–15 |
| Global fallback penalty | −5 to −15 |
| Fewer than 5 comps | −10 |

### Buy vs Sell Strategies

**Buy thresholds** — maximum prices a dealer should pay:

| Tier | Formula | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| 70% | FMV × 0.70 | Target for maximum margin |
| 75% | FMV × 0.75 | Standard dealer buy |
| 80% | FMV × 0.80 | Thin margin, high-demand items |

If an asking price is provided:
- ≤ 75% of FMV → **BUY**
- ≤ 80% of FMV → **BUY (thin margin)**
- \> 80% of FMV → **PASS**

**Sell tiers** — suggested list prices:

| Tier | Formula | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Fast | eBay median × 0.92 | Quick sale, undercut market |
| Normal | eBay median | Market price |
| Premium | eBay median × 1.05 | Patient sell (1.15× if pop < 200) |
| Offer Floor | min(P25, fast) | Lowest acceptable offer |

## Tests

```bash
npm test                                          # all suites
npx jest __tests__/coinSearch.relevance.test.js    # denomination relevance only
npx jest __tests__/coinSearch.ebayKeywords.test.js # eBay keyword quality only
npx jest __tests__/marketAggregator.test.js        # market matrix aggregator
npx jest __tests__/marketRoute.test.js             # market route integration
```

### Test Metrics & Monitoring

```bash
npm run test:metrics    # run tests + append metrics to .test-metrics/test-runs.jsonl
npm run test:summary    # print failure frequency, flaky tests, duration trends, slowest tests
```

The **Test Monitor** system records per-run metrics (timestamp, branch, commit, pass/fail counts, slowest files/tests, flake hints) to a JSONL log. The summary script surfaces:

- **Failure frequency** — tests ranked by how often they fail
- **Flaky test detection** — tests that pass and fail across runs
- **Duration trends** — avg/min/max over recent runs
- **Slowest tests** — tests exceeding the 500 ms budget
- **New failures** — tests that broke since the last green run

A Copilot agent persona (`.github/agents/test-monitor.agent.md`) can be invoked to diagnose failures, quarantine flaky tests, and suggest fixes. See [docs/testing/test-monitor.md](docs/testing/test-monitor.md) for full usage.

Runs **Jest** across 28 test suites:
